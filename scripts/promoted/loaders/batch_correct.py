"""Verified ComBat batch correction for a :class:`~loaders.data_loading.Dataset`.

PROJECT COPY seeded from the plugin template ``lib/common/batch_correct.py``
(``batch-correct-combat`` v0.2), carried over verbatim except the package-layout
adaptation: ``from loaders.data_loading import ...`` instead of
``from common.data_loading import ...`` (see ``loaders/data_loading.py``'s module
docstring for why). No other logic differs from the template.

BATCH LABEL ONLY — a deliberate anti-cheating decision (do not "fix" this):
:func:`combat_correct` hands ComBat the batch vector and **nothing else** (pycombat's
``X`` "effects to preserve" stays ``None``). When batch is confounded with the biology
of interest, telling ComBat to *protect* that biology lets it attribute the confounded
variance to biology rather than batch — which launders a possible batch artifact into
the very signal you then test for. Batch-only correction is the conservative choice: it
cannot manufacture signal. Its honest cost is the mirror risk — it can *remove* real
biology that aligns with batch — so two safeguards are mandatory:

  1. Run :func:`assess_batch_confounding` first and surface the result to the scientist.
     It warns (graded) when batch is perfectly **or** strongly confounded with a
     covariate of interest (correction would then delete/attenuate that effect).
     Scientist sign-off before correcting is a workflow gate (the Stage-3/4 command).
  2. Keep the uncorrected ``Dataset`` and run the key analysis BOTH ways as a robustness
     check. "Signal survives" is supporting evidence; "signal disappears" means it is
     confounded with batch. Two honest caveats: partial confounding *attenuates* real
     biology too, and feeding ComBat output to a naive significance test inflates
     significance (variance deflation, Nygaard 2016) — for *testing*, prefer modeling
     batch as a covariate over pre-correcting. Use ComBat output for
     visualization/clustering and this robustness check.

SCALE: ComBat's additive + multiplicative empirical-Bayes model assumes a roughly
Gaussian per-feature distribution, so it must run on a **log** scale (``log2`` /
``log10`` / ``ln`` / ``glog2`` / ``zscore``), never on linear intensities. The scale tag
enforces this.

Dataset-specific decisions (which samples are QC and should be excluded from the batch
fit, sample relabelings) live in the project entry scripts, never here. ``sample_mask``
is the generic hook: rows it excludes pass through uncorrected.
