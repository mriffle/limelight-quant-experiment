"""Univariate differential abundance — one feature at a time, then BH across features.

TEMPLATE (lib/) — a *seed* for a project's differential-abundance script, not a finished
analysis. Copy it into the project's ``scripts/`` and adapt the call site per study
(which metadata column is the contrast, which are nuisance covariates). Held to the
correctness charter (conventions/correctness.md) and the statistics convention
(conventions/statistics.md): **assume nothing, verify everything, fail loud; no bare p —
every result is effect + CI + corrected p.**

The four canonical univariate tests are **one family with a swappable** ``method=`` —
the *downstream is identical* (a per-feature effect + CI + p + BH-q table; the volcano
and p-value histogram read off it), so they are not four templates:

  * ``ols``        — per-feature linear model (general form; adjusts for covariates).
  * ``moderated``  — limma-style empirical-Bayes variance moderation of the OLS fit
                     (the **default** — borrowing variance across features is more
                     powerful and honest at omics scale; conventions/statistics.md).
  * ``welch``      — Welch's unequal-variance two-group t-test (no covariates).
  * ``mannwhitney``— Mann-Whitney U rank test, the nonparametric fallback when
                     normality fails (no covariates; effect = Hodges-Lehmann shift).

The study-agnostic interface is a **contrast + covariates** specification over the
:class:`~common.data_loading.Dataset` metadata (§A.0b of the build plan): name the
column under test and the nuisance columns to adjust for; the treatment-contrast design
is assembled internally. There are **no per-study design-matrix builders** — those bake
in one study's schema and belong in the project copy (interaction / transformed models
are a documented project-local adaptation until a ``formula=`` escape hatch lands).

Scale: the effect is a **log2 fold change**, so the input should be on a log scale
(``log2``/``glog2``); on a non-log scale the test still runs but the effect is a raw
difference and the normality assumption is violated, so a
:class:`DifferentialAbundanceScaleWarning` is raised and the effect label stays honest
about the scale. **Missing values are an upstream Stage-2 decision** (the matrix should
already be resolved — dropped / imputed / zeroed; conventions/statistics.md): this
template **never silently imputes or zeros**, it **raises** on any ``NaN`` in the
abundances as a defense-in-depth backstop. A feature that is constant within the
analyzed samples is legitimately untestable — its p is left ``NaN`` and excluded from
the BH family (not an error).

Sample set: the caller passes the **experimental subset** (controls excluded upstream;
conventions/statistics.md) and records the analyzed set in the finding's
``provenance.params``. This template does not re-filter — it tests whatever it is given.

Project-local adaptations (raloxifene/HLM LFQ project, Stage 4) — everything else is the
lib template unchanged:

  1. Import path ``loaders.data_loading`` (the project's Dataset contract).
  2. The result records ``residual_df`` (the OLS residual df, n - n_params; ``None``
     for welch/mannwhitney) and ``n_prior_floored`` (see 4).
  3. The table gains two columns: ``se`` (the standard error the t and CI use —
     moderated for ``moderated``) and ``sigma`` (the per-feature *unmoderated* residual
     SD of the OLS fit; ``NaN`` for welch/mannwhitney).
  4. **Zero-residual-variance guard in the empirical-Bayes prior fit (limma's
     ``fitFDist`` rule).** Quantized quantities (spectral counts, 3-decimal NSAF) can
     fit a blocked design exactly, leaving a residual variance that is zero up to
     floating round-off (~1e-30). The template counted such a value as a valid
     positive variance, so ``log(1e-30)`` ≈ -69 entered the moment fit and inflated
     the spread of log-variances (shrinking ``d0``). As in limma, variances are
     clipped at 0, zeros are kept in the fit but **floored at 1e-5 x the median
     variance** before the log, and a :class:`ZeroResidualVarianceWarning` reports
     how many were floored. The floor is inactive (identical numbers to the
     template) whenever no variance falls below it.

    """Test every feature for differential abundance across ``contrast``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset:
        The **experimental subset** on a **log2-like** scale (controls excluded and
        missing values resolved upstream — conventions/statistics.md). Abundances are
        finite (a ``NaN`` raises).
    contrast:
        The metadata column under test. A non-numeric column (or one named in
        ``categorical``) is a factor — its effect is *non-reference vs reference*, with
        ``k-1`` terms for ``k`` levels. A numeric column is a continuous slope.
    covariates:
        Nuisance metadata columns to adjust for (batch lives here for significance
        testing — conventions/statistics.md). Only ``ols``/``moderated`` adjust; passing
        covariates with ``welch``/``mannwhitney`` is an error.
    reference:
        Optional per-column reference level ``{column: level}``. Default is the
        sorted-first level. The reference controls the effect sign and is recorded.
    method:
        ``"moderated"`` (default), ``"ols"``, ``"welch"``, or ``"mannwhitney"``.
    categorical:
        Metadata columns to force-treat as factors even though they are numeric (the
        ``batch = 1/2/3`` case). Numeric columns not listed here are continuous slopes
        (with a low-cardinality warning).
    alpha:
        Two-sided significance level for the confidence intervals (default ``0.05`` →
        95% CI). Does not affect the BH-q values.
