"""Save figures the way the workflow requires: dual export + a separate legend image.

Project module seeded verbatim from the plugin ``lib/figures`` template
``figure-io`` v0.3 (only this header and ``__script_meta__`` were adapted). Held to
the correctness charter (conventions/correctness.md): **assume nothing, verify
everything, fail loud.**

Encodes three visualization conventions mechanically (conventions/visualization.md), so
every figure starts compliant instead of relying on each script to remember:

  * **Dual export.** Every figure is written as an **SVG** (vector master, for editing /
    publication) *and* a **PNG at 300 DPI** (the raster the figure-reviewer inspects and
    findings embed). :func:`save_figure` writes both from one call.
  * **Legend as a separate image.** A matplotlib legend baked into the plot routinely
    overlaps the data. So the legend is rendered as its **own figure** and dual-exported
    to ``<base>.legend.svg`` / ``<base>.legend.png`` beside the main figure, which stays
    clean. Pass it as ``legend_fig``; the plot template builds the swatch/colorbar key.
  * **Publication-ready defaults.** :func:`publication_style` is a shared matplotlib
    style (legible fonts at print scale, no chartjunk, clean spines). A figure script
    renders *inside* this context so its defaults are set centrally, not re-specified.

The set each plot produces — ``<base>.svg`` + ``<base>.png`` (+ ``<base>.legend.svg`` /
``<base>.legend.png`` when a legend figure is supplied) in the figure's directory under
``figures/`` (``figures/<phase>/<family>[/<label>]/`` — conventions/visualization.md,
*Where figures live*) — is what the figure-reviewer checks for.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fig:
        The main figure to save.
    output_dir:
        Destination directory (created if absent). In a project this is the figure's
        directory under the structured layout, e.g. ``figures/qc/pca`` or
        ``figures/analysis/differential-abundance/genotype-vs-wt``.
    base_name:
        Filename stem (no extension), e.g. ``"pca_experimental_by_genotype"``. Must be a
        bare name, not a path — a stem with a path separator is rejected so the figure
        and its legend cannot land in different places.
    legend_fig:
        Optional companion legend figure (a standalone swatch/colorbar key). When given
        it is dual-exported to ``<base>.legend.svg`` / ``<base>.legend.png`` so the
        legend never overlaps the plot. ``None`` for figures needing no separate legend.
    dpi:
        PNG resolution (default 300, the convention's floor). The SVG is scale-free.
    close:
        If ``True`` (default), close the figure(s) on **every** exit — success or
        exception — so a batch loop that catches errors never leaks open figures. Pass
        ``False`` to keep inspecting them (e.g. in tests); the caller then owns closing.

    Returns
    -------

        Paths to ``(svg, png, legend_svg, legend_png)``; the legend paths are ``None``
